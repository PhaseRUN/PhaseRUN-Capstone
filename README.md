# PhaseRun

## Description

You ever want to run a marathon, but start to get nervous, thinking "Am I ready yet?". 
Well guess what? We are here to help! 
We built this project to help all types of runners locate those races that they have time to be ready for based on 
their running experience, activity level, age, and our special fitness calculation algorithm. 
With this web app, we remove the headache of sifting through the available races and only show the what you have time to train for.
